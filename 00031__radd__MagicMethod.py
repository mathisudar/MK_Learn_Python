Adding Different Types of Objects Together


#1 totalWeight = weightObj1 + 300 # addition of 'object with int'
     TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'Weight' and 'int' 


#2 totalWeight =  300 + weightObj1 # addition of int with object
    TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'Weight'

The Python __radd__() method implements the reverse addition operation 
that is addition with reflected, swapped operands. 


So, when you call x + y, Python attempts to call x.__add__(y). 
Only if the method is not implemented on the left operand, 
Python attempts to call __radd__ on the right operand.


And if this isnâ€™t implemented either, it raises a TypeError.
